In Git, the "head" commit refers to the latest commit in a branch. To make a commit the head commit of a branch in GitHub, you can follow these steps:

Open the terminal or Git Bash and navigate to your local repository.

Checkout the branch that you want to set the head commit for. For example, to switch to the main branch, run the following command:



git checkout main
Identify the commit hash of the commit you want to set as the head. You can view the commit history by running:



git log
This will show you a list of commits, each with a hash (a long alphanumeric string). Find the hash of the commit you want to set as the head.

Set the head of the branch to the commit hash by running the following command:


git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH
Replace COMMIT_HASH with the hash of the commit you want to set as the head.

Force push the branch to GitHub by running:

git push --force
This will overwrite the remote branch with your local branch, effectively setting the head to the commit you specified.

Note: Be careful when using git push --force, as it overwrites the remote branch and can cause data loss. Make sure you have a backup of your repository or consult with other team members before using this command.
